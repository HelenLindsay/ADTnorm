\title{Identify the valley outliers and impute by valley by closet neighbor samples
on the graph.}
\usage{
get_neighbors(
  target_sample,
  adt_marker_select,
  cell_x_adt,
  cell_x_feature,
  nearest_neighbor_n = 3,
  nearest_neighbor_threshold = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_sample}{The target sample whose valley need to be imputed. Find
the neighbor samples whose density distribution is close to the target sample.}

\item{adt_marker_select}{The marker whose valley need to be imputed. Fine the
neighbor samples whose density distribution is close to the target sample of
the same ADT marker.}

\item{cell_x_adt}{Matrix of ADT raw counts in cells (rows) by ADT markers
(columns) format.}

\item{cell_x_feature}{Matrix of cells (rows) by cell features (columns) such
as cell type, sample, and batch related information.}

\item{nearest_neighbor_n}{Number of top nearest neighbor samples to detect.}

\item{nearest_neighbor_threshold}{Threshold to call neighbor samples.}
}
\description{
This function identify the valley that tend to be outliers compared to other
valley locations and try to find the closest samples that have similar
density distribution to impute the valley. If no neighbor sample is detected,
the valley will remain as original.
