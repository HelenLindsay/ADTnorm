get_peak_midpoint and get_peak_mode are mostly the same code,
get_peak is intended to replace

adts are identified using which(colnames == adt), would be safer to explicitly
use names

I think the addition of bimodal_peak / trimodal peak removed some CD4 specific
code

In get_peak, I was trying to separate the chains of if conditions into discrete
functions, to allow for inputting a custom peak workflow or more easily changing
the workflow.  I wrote workflows as a list of checks, a list of actions to take
if check is true, and a list of actions to take if check is false.

I wrote the functions that start with .

Options of parallelising - either at marker level in ADTnorm or at sample level
in get_peak
