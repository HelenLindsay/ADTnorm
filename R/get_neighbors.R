#' Identify the valley outliers and impute by valley by closet neighbor samples
#' on the graph.
#'
#' This function identify the valley that tend to be outliers compared to other
#' valley locations and try to find the closest samples that have similar
#' density distribution to impute the valley. If no neighbor sample is detected,
#' the valley will remain as original.
#' @param target_sample The target sample whose valley need to be imputed. Find
#' the neighbor samples whose density distribution is close to the target sample.
#' @param adt_marker_select The marker whose valley need to be imputed. Fine the
#' neighbor samples whose density distribution is close to the target sample of
#' the same ADT marker.
#' @param cell_x_adt Matrix of ADT raw counts in cells (rows) by ADT markers
#' (columns) format.
#' @param cell_x_feature Matrix of cells (rows) by cell features (columns) such
#' as cell type, sample, and batch related information.
#' @param nearest_neighbor_n Number of top nearest neighbor samples to detect.
#' @param nearest_neighbor_threshold Threshold to call neighbor samples.
